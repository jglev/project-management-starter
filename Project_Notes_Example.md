# Conventions in this document

- Notes are generally chronological.
  - Hence, this note was written later than the note above it, as a rule of thumb.
- Todo items are indented hierarchically: **All more-indented items must be marked Done for the item they're indented under to be able to be (a) marked Done, or (b) even worked on,** depending on the task.
- Once all Todo tasks are marked Done (i.e., as soon as the entire board is green), the project is Done.
  - Even for a nebulous project like a dissertation, this approach provides a clear definition of "Done."
- "`DEADLINE:`" and "`SCHEDULED:`" tags follow [this page's definitions](https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-Scheduling.html):
  - "`DEADLINE:`" means that "the task... is supposed to be finished on that date."
  - "`SCHEDULED:`" means that "you are planning to start working on that task on the given date."
- Dates are written in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2020-06-26`). This provides consistency. In addition, it allows sorting items (or files, if they are named by date) chronologically -- items sorted alphabetically will be chronological, using this naming convention.
- Because these notes are all just text, there's no worry about being able to migrate them to a different system in the future.
